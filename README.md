## Speeduino Tweaks
Speeduino Tweaks is a fork of the main Speeduino Reposotory with my own experimental code patches added. I wouldn't recommended building this and running it on a car, its likely unstable at any given time and is definetly not documented like the Main Speeduino Repo is.

Current Features:

-Long Term Fuel Trimming (Adds LTFT to the existing o2 sensor code, to account for fueling error over time)
